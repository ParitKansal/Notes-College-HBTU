### **Android component model**

Defines how Android apps are built and interact with each other using specific building blocks, known as *components*, each designed to handle different functions of an app.
Different componets :


| **Component**          | **Purpose**                                           | **Example**                                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Activities**          | Represents a single screen for user interaction.     | A photo gallery app with different screens like the main view and photo editor. |
| **Services**            | Runs background tasks without user interface.        | A music player continuing to play music when switching to another app. |
| **Broadcast Receivers** | Listens for system-wide messages to trigger actions.  | Reacting to a “battery low” notification by dimming the screen or saving progress. |
| **Content Providers**   | Manages and shares structured data between apps.     | The Contacts app sharing contact data with messaging or email apps. |



#### **Important Concepts in the Android Component Model**

* **Intent**: This is a messaging object that lets components communicate.  
* **Lifecycle**: Each component has a specific lifecycle, which means they go through stages like “created,” “started,” “paused,” and “destroyed.”

### Managing Applications Data 

| **Storage Type**         | **Description**                                          | **Advantages**                        | **Disadvantages**                      | **Best For**                                      |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Internal Storage**      | Stores data privately on the device’s internal memory.   | Secure, private to the app.           | Limited storage space.                 | Sensitive data that needs privacy.               |
| **SD Cards**              | Uses SD card for additional storage.                     | Expands storage for large files.      | Not secure, not all devices support it. | Large files like images or videos.               |
| **SQLite Databases**      | Structured data storage using relational model.         | Efficient for structured data.        | Requires SQL knowledge.                | Complex or related data, like user info.         |
| **Shared Preferences**    | Stores small data as key-value pairs.                    | Easy to use, persists across sessions.| Limited to basic data types.           | Small data like settings or preferences.         |
| **Web Storage**           | Stores data remotely on web servers or cloud.           | Unlimited storage, syncs across devices. | Needs a network connection.            | Data shared across devices or users.             |

## **UI**

### **User Interface (UI) Design in Android**

UI design in Android means creating the screens and interactive elements of an app that users see on their devices.

### **Key UI Components**

* **Main Action Bar (MAR)**: The main bar where users can navigate and access key options.  
* **Split Action Bar (SAB)**: An additional action bar, useful on larger screens, for extra options.  
* **Content Area**: The main area of the screen where the core content of the app is displayed.

### **Views and ViewGroups**

* **Views**: These are the basic elements you see in an app, such as buttons, checkboxes, and text fields. They respond to user actions like clicks and touches.  
* **ViewGroups**: These are containers that hold other Views or ViewGroups. They help organize and structure the UI by grouping different elements together in layouts.

### **Layouts in Android**

Layouts define how elements are arranged on the screen. In Android, layouts are commonly specified using XML (a markup language), which is simple to use and allows easy control over element positioning and organization.

**Advantages of Using XML Layouts**:

* **Popular Format**
* **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps the UI design separate from the app’s logic, making it easy to change one without affecting the other.  
* **Easy to Use**

#### **Types of Layouts**

1. **Linear Layout**  
2. **Frame Layout**: Serves as a simple container, usually for displaying a single view or element.  
3. **Relative Layout**: Allows elements to be positioned relative to each other.  
4. **Table Layout**  
5. **Constraint Layout**: A flexible layout that lets you position and scale elements based on specific rules or constraints.

Non-functional requirements describe how the app performs its functions. They define the quality attributes, system behaviors, and constraints under which the application operates.

**Examples:**

* **Availability:** The app should be available 24/7 with minimal downtime.  
* **Reliability:** The app must automatically restart after a crash and recover smoothly.  
* **Scalability:** The app should handle an increasing number of users without performance loss.  
* **Performance:** The app should support 100 simultaneous users with a response time of less than 2 seconds.  
* **Security:** The app must protect user data and have access controls in place to prevent unauthorized use.  
* **Usability:** The app should have an intuitive interface that is easy for users to navigate.  
* **Extensibility:** The app should be designed to easily integrate new features in the future.

   - **TCP vs. UDP**: TCP is slower but reliable (e.g., banking apps). UDP is faster but less reliable (e.g., video streaming).
   - **HTTP/2 & HTTP/3**: Faster than HTTP/1.1, ideal for data-heavy apps (e.g., social media, news).

2. **Reliability**
   - **TCP**: Ensures reliable data transmission (e.g., financial apps).
   - **QUIC**: Fast and reliable, ideal for interactive web apps.

3. **Battery Life**
   - **Persistent Connections**: WebSockets keep a steady connection, saving battery (e.g., chat apps).
   - **Lightweight Protocols**: MQTT is efficient, great for apps with frequent notifications.

4. **Data Usage**
   - **Protocol Overheads**: Newer protocols (e.g., HTTP/2, HTTP/3) reduce data overhead, improving speed.
   - **Compression**: HTTP/2 reduces data size, saving data on apps with images or text.

5. **Security**
   - **TLS Encryption**: HTTPS keeps data secure but uses more power. QUIC offers security with better performance.
   - **VPN**: Adds extra security but can slow down the connection.

6. **Network Conditions**
   - **Adaptive Protocols**: QUIC and HTTP/3 adjust to network disruptions, ensuring app stability.
   - **Caching**: HTTP protocols can cache data, speeding up apps and reducing data usage on slow networks.

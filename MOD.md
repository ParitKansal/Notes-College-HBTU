### Processes of Mobile Application Testing
1. **Outlining the Process:** Plan testing activities, select devices, and prepare a compatibility matrix.
2. **Identify Testing Type:** Choose the appropriate testing type based on the app.
3. **Test Cases Design:** Create manual and automated test cases for all features.
4. **Manual and Automation Testing:** Execute both manual and automated tests to find issues.
5. **Usability and Beta Testing:** Test the app's user-friendliness with in-house and beta testers.
6. **Performance Testing:** Evaluate app performance and scalability.
7. **Complete Testing and Closure:** Final testing and regression testing before sign-off.

**Final Report:** Includes bug count, types of testing, and compatibility matrix.
